## Completion

```
The steps I took to coplete this challenge were:
- Added comments in both the HTML and CSS files to clearlly denote what each section of code does/styles.
- Condenced CSS code to reduce the number of repeated entries.
-- Eliminated entries with duplicated styling statements.
- Optimized HTML code.
-- Delited **id** atributes that, for the purpose of this challenge, were not needed.
-- Added **class** atributes to tags to be able to share styling between them with on CSS entry.
-- Added **atl** atributes to **img** tags.
-- Cleared the 'div soup' by using semantic HTML tags.
