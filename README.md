```
First Callenge. Due date: 26th of December 2021.
```
## Goal of the Project
***
```
To refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible and to improve its search engine optimization.
```
## User Story
***
```
Horiseon Social Solutions requested for their codebase to follow accessibility standards
so that their site would be optimized for search engines.
```

## Criteria For Completion
***
```
1. The use of semantic HTML elements.
2. The use of a logical structure for the elements.
3. The use of discriptive alt attributes for img tags.
4. The use of sequential order in the heading attributes.
5. The use of a concise and discriptive title
```
## Completion
***
The steps I took to coplete this challenge were:
- Added comments in both the HTML and CSS files to clearlly denote what each section of code does/styles.
- Condenced CSS code to reduce the number of repeated entries.
   - Eliminated entries with duplicated styling statements.
   - Reorganized the entries to follow the flow of the HTML file.
- Optimized HTML code.
   - Delited **id** atributes that, for the purpose of this challenge, were not needed.
   - Added **class** atributes to tags to be able to share styling between them with one CSS entry.
   - Added **atl** atributes to **img** tags.
   - Cleared the 'div soup' by using semantic HTML tags.
